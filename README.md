# Remo Frontend Assignment

This is a frontend challenge. The task is to build a notification system UI/UX for the platform; it must include in-app and push notifications. To test this out locally, clone this repo by doing `git clone https://github.com/stonebinox/remo-frontend.git`

Then type `cd remo-frontend`

If you're using `npm`, then use `npm install`. If ypu're using `yarn`, then type `yarn` or `yarn install`. This should install the dependencies.

Once that's done, you can type `npm run` or `yarn start` depending on what you're using.

The project should be live at http://localhost:3000
